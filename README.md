# 150g-Drum-Combat-Robot

# About the bot
This is going to be a 150g eggbeater/drum combat robot that will fight at many comps. This robot is based off of the design of the 1lb full combat ant called vector. This robot has a 37g eggbeater weapon running on a 2800kv repeat weapon motor on 2s. Yes this is way to much overkill for a robot as small as this. The eggbeater is made out of s7 tool steel. This is defentily a hard hitter battlebot!! The frame is made out of clear 98a tpu for taking impacts and also be sturdy. The armor is made out of black 95a made for absorbimg impact all day long (I hope). One thing that makes every robot look good is carbon fiber. This epic machine has a carbon fiber top plate for a rigid frame and to have a light weight top lid. It also does not bend like aluminum does. This robot is 2 wheel drive, power by two n10s. This robot is definetly a hard hitting robot because I put all the weight in my weapon like a responsible person would do. :)

# Dragster Jr. the smaller but not to be mess with 150g robot.

The reason why I wanted to make this robot is because of many things. First I love combat robotics and have made many 1lb 3lb and 15lb robots before. I always wanted to try making a 150g combat robot and now is my chance!With my experience in combat there was always one weapon I wanted to make and that was an eggbeater. Since this is a smaller weight class the 500 dollar eggbeater is now only around 100. This gives me the chance to make a robot I always wanted to make before. I have seen a battlebot called vector on youtube that has a big eggbeater with a really high kv weapon motor making it spin over 220 mph. This is a robot that I been waiting for to make for a long time and now I have a chance of making it.
