# About the bot
This is going to be a 150g eggbeater/drum combat robot that will fight at many comps. This robot is based off of the design of the 1lb full combat ant called vector. This robot has a 37g eggbeater weapon running on a 2800kv repeat weapon motor on 2s. Yes this is way to much overkill for a robot as small as this.
