# Total Time Spent 1 hour

# June 24, 2025 :Day 1, the start of the design.

I have made many 1lb combat robots and one thing I always wanted to make is a drum/eggbeater. Making a drum/eggbeater with like titanium would be really expensive. So instead I am going to make a 150g bot that is a drum to be cheaper. The drum would be made out of aluminum with potential impact teath.

My goal with this robot is too but all the weigfht into my weapon so I am going to do something like an 1lb robot I know call vector. By not having wheel armor and using that weight I gain with no armor towards my weapon. This will potential be better or just a bad idea.

This is a 150g eggbeater.

# June 25, 2025 :Day 2, Fidnng Electronics and the start of Cad!!

I have made many other combat robots and for this tiny of a robot I am going to use a HV Maleki. A maleki is a reciever with 3 brush esc built into it. I already have one on hand so I do not need one. :)

For drive, I am planning on running 2 n20s. I already have some n20s from turnabot on hand too. :)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2a3c0da-aee9-49a6-9394-90f127d840a5)

The weapon has a bruhless motor meaning I woukd need to run a brushless esc. I am planning on running an 30 or 35amp esc. I have found these LANRC 35A ESC 2S-6S Brushless ESC Lipo BLHeli_S Electronic Speed. Only weights 6.6 grams!! [image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caddb57a-d1a4-4daf-8c36-54caf876156f)


For the weapon motor, a light but powerful weapon motor. After asking around I have found the FLASH HOBBY BE1806 2300KV Brushless Motor Race Edition that is reliable and is only 18g!! https://www.amazon.com/FLASH-HOBBY-Brushless-Multicopters-160-210/dp/B08P5NYPSF?crid=EQ4JQ962UXVJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.U90jhGsQGGXMEwaUxvzk48HnMLo67p6-mPxNleFnu3HFKt64LqoMZtbiOANZS_aRSmLfFtNl0AxJMwi3T4anZOZY_tKnFLhtZzafRpdT6RFbssVkQ4yBvrYGVG6itK-dl8r-o0W_qn7UqD0hKITR9tjioxX0YVi3r1m6Hy-MP5CZUgppO5gJyLXpLUXS8EXFKFFCo6uH4NhXV1PVzqQqHA.fslRJlFLbqJ4JE7HCJYE6OTEDNc0PDhinF1i0BilqA0&dib_tag=se&keywords=1806+brushless+motor&qid=1718426824&sprefix=1806%2Caps%2C153&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9waG9uZV9zZWFyY2hfYXRm&psc=1

For the switch I am running the fingertech power switchs. I have one extra so I do not need this. :)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aebfa1a0-6b2a-4832-a659-6acff0f6f209)

And finally I need a battery to power the whole bot. Am planning on running 2s and probbaly below 200 or maybe 300. I think I am planning on running 300amp because it might be overkill but at least i can keep my weapon on for longer now! :) These are the batteries I am planning on using! My friend will let me buy some of his so for now I do not need these!!

Here is a basic setup on how most of the electronics would be!!

Palying around with electronics more. For a robot this tiny you defentily want to spend some time with this. It will be helpful later on!!

I spent some time on some uprights and made them a little goofy but I think it be good for now!! :)

 I went check how much it is and it turns out to be a decent price even with a hard material like tool steal. Am going to redesign to be  normal eggbeater. 

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c6eac69-b53c-4bed-b7b4-3d94ab1ddfd3)

 After some time working on the eggbeater I am going to keep it aluminum because this only has 150g to use. Made many other eggbeaters before this one.

Redoing the cad for this smaller but wider weapon that would be made out of tool steal s7.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1bd2225-d98d-4cc0-a33f-49686a9ef89d)

I decided to change to this motor that is made for combat.
