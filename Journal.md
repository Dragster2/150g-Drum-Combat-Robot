# Total Time Spent 1 hour

# June 25, 2025 :Day 1, the start of the design.

I have made many 1lb combat robots and one thing I always wanted to make is a drum/eggbeater. Making a drum/eggbeater with like titanium would be really expensive. So instead I am going to make a 150g bot that is a drum to be cheaper. The drum would be made out of aluminum with potential impact teath.

My goal with this robot is too but all the weigfht into my weapon so I am going to do something like an 1lb robot I know call vector. By not having wheel armor and using that weight I gain with no armor towards my weapon. This will potential be better or just a bad idea.

**Total Time Spent: 1hr**

# June 25, 2025 :Day 2, Fidnng Electronics and Starting the cad!!

I have made many other combat robots and for this tiny of a robot I am going to use a HV Maleki. A maleki is a reciever with 3 brush esc built into it. I already have one on hand so I do not need one. :)

For drive, I am planning on running 2 n20s. I already have some n20s from turnabot on hand too. :)

The weapon has a bruhless motor meaning I woukd need to run a brushless esc. I am planning on running an 30 or 35amp esc.
