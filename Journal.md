# Total Time Spent 1 hour

# June 25, 2025 :Day 1, the start of the design.

I have made many 1lb combat robots and one thing I always wanted to make is a drum/eggbeater. Making a drum/eggbeater with like titanium would be really expensive. So instead I am going to make a 150g bot that is a drum to be cheaper. The drum would be made out of aluminum with potential impact teath.

My goal with this robot is too but all the weigfht into my weapon so I am going to do something like an 1lb robot I know call vector. By not having wheel armor and using that weight I gain with no armor towards my weapon. This will potential be better or just a bad idea.
